**EEG-BASED MENTAL WORKLOAD ASSESSMENT USING MACHINE LEARNING     (2019 - 2020)** <br>
_Supervisors: Dr. Shahzad Rasool, Dr. Adnan Maqsood, Dr Ammar Mushtaq_<br>
EEG is an objective assessment technique used to record brain activities to monitor brain states
such as, stress, emotions, drowsiness and workload. In this research EEG is employed to assess
mental workload from human brain. We developed a pipeline for EEG based mental workload
assessment using deep machine learning <br>
